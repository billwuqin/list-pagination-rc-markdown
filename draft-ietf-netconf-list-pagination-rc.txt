             RESTCONF Extensions to Support List Pagination
              draft-ietf-netconf-list-pagination-rc-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a mapping of the list pagination mechanism
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-list-pagination] to RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   This document updates RFC 8040, to declare "list" and "leaf-list" as
   valid resource targets for the RESTCONF GET operation, to define GET
   query parameters necessary for list pagination, and to define a
   media-type for XML-based lists.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a mapping of the list pagination mechanism
   defined in [I-D.ietf-netconf-list-pagination] to RESTCONF [RFC8040].

   This document updates RFC 8040, as described in Section 2.  Declaring
   "list" and "leaf-list" as valid resource targets for the GET
   operation is necessary for list pagination.

1.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Conventions

   Various examples in this document use "BASE64VALUE=" as a placeholder
   value for binary data that has been base64 encoded (per Section 9.8
   of [RFC7950]).  This placeholder value is used because real base64
   encoded structures are often many lines long and hence distracting to
   the example being presented.

2.  Update to RFC 8040

2.1.  Resource Targets

   This document extends Section 3.5 of [RFC8040] to add "list" and
   "leaf-list" nodes (not just their entries) as valid data resources
   for the "GET" operation.

2.2.  Media Type

   This document extends Section 3.2 of [RFC8040] to add a new media
   type, "application/yang-data+xml-list", to encode "list" and "leaf-
   list" nodes in XML.

   The "application/yang-data+xml-list" media-type defines a pseudo top-
   level element called "xml-list" that is used to wrap the response
   set, thus ensuring that a single top-level element is returned for
   the XML encoding", as required by Section 4.3 of [RFC8040].

   For JSON, the existing "application/yang-data+json" media type is
   sufficient, as the JSON format has built-in support for encoding
   arrays.

   The "application/yang-data+xml-list" media type is registered in
   Section 3.2.1.

2.3.  Query Parameters

   This document extends Section 4.8 of [RFC8040] to add new query
   parameters "limit", "offset", "cursor", "direction", "sort-by",
   "locale", "where", and "sublist-list".

   These six query parameters correspond to those defined in Sections
   3.1 and 3.2 in [I-D.ietf-netconf-list-pagination].

   |               |         | specified, then the result set is       |
   |               |         | traversed in the "forwards" direction.  |
   |               |         |                                         |

   |               |         | default order is used, per YANG's       |

   |               |         | not specified, the server chooses what  |
   |               |         | locale is used for collation.           |
   |               |         |                                         |
   | where         | GET,    | Specifies a filter expression that      |
   |               | HEAD    | result set entries must match.  If      |
   |               |         | not specified, then no entries are      |
   |               |         | filtered from the result set.           |
   |               |         |                                         |
   | sublist-limit | GET,    | Limits the number of entries returned   |
   |               | HEAD    | returned for descendent lists and       |
   |               |         | leaf-lists. If not specified, the       |
   |               |         | number of entries that may be returned  |
